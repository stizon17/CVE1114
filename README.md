# CVE1114 Python for Surveying

This project is part of a university module aimed at applying Python programming to solve problems in the field of surveying. The course focuses on leveraging Python's powerful data analysis, mathematical, and visualization libraries to assist in surveying and geospatial data processing.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop practical programming skills that can be applied to surveying tasks. The use of Python allows for automation of repetitive tasks, analysis of geospatial data, and creation of accurate models and maps. This project demonstrates how Python can be used to process, analyze, and visualize survey data efficiently, providing valuable insights for decision-making in civil engineering, construction, and environmental projects.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing**: Automates data manipulation and analysis from raw survey data, including coordinates, measurements, and elevation data.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Implements algorithms for geospatial calculations, such as distance measurement, area calculations, and data interpolation.
- **Visualization**: Uses Pythonâ€™s plotting libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly to generate professional-quality maps and graphs for visualizing survey data.
- **Automation**: Provides automation for common surveying tasks such as coordinate transformations, error checking, and data integration.
- **Surveying Tools**: Includes functions for working with surveying instruments and measurement data formats.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computing and efficient data handling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Plotly**: For data visualization and map generation.
- **Geopy / Shapely**: For geospatial analysis and handling geographical data.
